        <p>Fettuccine Alfredo, originally from Italy, has been a growing success in the United States, where the dish remains a true classic of Italian restaurants today. This pasta recipe stands out for both its simplicity and its richness, thanks to its creamy butter and Parmesan sauce. In Italy, fettuccine are fresh made pasta and texture and consistency may vary from town to town depending on the recipe. This type of pasta is often served with a ragu, and of course with Alfredo sauce.</p>
