    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a rich, creamy, and hearty Italian-American pasta dish featuring fettuccine noodles tossed in a velvety sauce of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, topping with seasoned, pan-fried chicken and garnished with parsley for a comforting, decadent meal.</p>

    <p><h3>Tips and Possible Variations</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoid pre-shredded cheese.</strong> For best results, use real Parmigiano-Reggiano right off the block. Pre-grated cheeses don't melt properly, making your sauce grainy. And they simply don't taste nearly as good. </li>
            <li><strong>Don't over-cook the chicken.</strong> Take the guesswork out of knowing when the chicken is done cooking by using an instant-read thermometer. Chicken is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temp of 165 degrees F (and keep in mind it will continue to cook a bit more as it rests.)</li>
            <li><strong>The pasta.</strong> A long, flat noodle like Fettuccine is perfect here, providing more surface area for the sauce to cling to. Linguini is another great choice, or penne which is able to catch the sauce in its ridges. Honestly though, any pasta works.</li>
            <li><strong>Have everything ready before you start:</strong> The list of ingredients is somewhat long, but it comes together fast - similar to a stir fry. So have everything prepped and ready to go before you start cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce too thin?</strong> We think the consistency of the sauce is on point, but if you find it too thin, no worries. You can either simmer for a few extra minutes or take it off the heat and let it sit for a minute or two before tossing with the pasta. It will thicken up. Alternatively, if you find it too thick, you can stir in a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
            <li><strong>Want to lighten it up?</strong> Let's not kid ourselves - this is a rich, creamy, high calorie meal. But you can cut back a little by using half-n-half or whole milk instead of the heavy whipping cream. Just keep in mind that the lower the fat content, the thinner the sauce.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

                    <li>3/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside. </li>
                <li><strong>Make the chicken:</strong> Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it's shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
                <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2 inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</strong> In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted. </li>
                <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking. constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
            </ol>
