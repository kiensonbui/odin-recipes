    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Honey garlic glazed salmon is a popular dish featuring flaky salmon fillets coated in a sweet, savory, and tangy glaze made from honey, garlic, soy sauce, and often other ingredients like ginger, lemon, and red pepper flakes, cooked by baking, pan-searing, or broiling to create a caramelized, sticky finish, perfect for a quick, flavorful meal.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><h5>Salmon</h5></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 (6 oz each) salmon fillets</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon blackening seasoning (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <p><h5>Sauce</h5></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoon butter</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoon water</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika, and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over med-high heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey, and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through</li>
                <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.</li>
                <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    
    <p><h3>Chef Tips</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you'd prefer, season salmon as directed, then pan sear in the pan. Flip over and sear on the other side, then remove to a plate. Add sauce ingredients to pan and cook until warmed through. Add salmon back to pan and spoon sauce over the salmon.</li>
                <li>A couple of readers have reported having a watery sauce, which I've never personally encountered during all the testing for this recipe. If you feel the sauce is a bit watery, you could reduce the amount of water used, or simmer the sauce a bit before adding the salmon.</li>
            </ul>
