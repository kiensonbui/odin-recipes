Creating My First TOP Project (Recipes)

This will be my first project I am creating using the skills I learned from TOP. With the basics of HTML, I will be using elements, tags, links, and images to create a website with some recipes that are amazing and important to my culture. I feel pretty confident in my knowledge of the elements and tags and what each one does, but still being new, I'm a little iffy on my memory. Learning how to create a good commit is something I'm not very confident in though. 

That's all. Thank you.
